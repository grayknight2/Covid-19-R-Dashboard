The data is from [this repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), so the data displayed inside the dashboad will be refreshed as the repository updates the data.


There are two Tabs:

- Countries.
- State-Provinces

The countries that are divided into provinces or states are not shown on Countries tab.
